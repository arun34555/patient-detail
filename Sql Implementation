Task: Patients+--------------+---------+| Column Name  | Type    |+--------------+---------+| patient_id   | int     || patient_name | varchar || conditions   | varchar |+--------------+---------+patient_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.'conditions' contains 0 or more code separated by spaces. This table contains information of the patients in the hospital. Write a solution to find the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix.Return the result table in any order.
To solve this problem, we can use SQL to query the Patients table and filter the rows where the conditions column contains a word that starts with the prefix DIAB1. Here's the query:
SELECT 
    patient_id, 
    patient_name, 
    conditions
FROM 
    Patients
WHERE 
    conditions LIKE '%DIAB1%';

Explanation of the Query:
SELECT Clause: Specifies the columns to retrieve: patient_id, patient_name, and conditions.
FROM Patients: Indicates the table to query.
WHERE conditions LIKE '%DIAB1%':
Filters rows where the conditions column contains a substring that starts with DIAB1.
The % wildcard allows matching any sequence of characters before or after DIAB1.
